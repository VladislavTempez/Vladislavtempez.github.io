I'm a computer science teacher in [Lyc√©e Descartes](https://www.lyc-descartes.fr/) in Tours (France).

Before that I was a PhD student at INRIA under supervision of [Jean-Baptiste Mouret](https://members.loria.fr/JBMouret/) and [Franck Ruffier](http://www.ism.univ-amu.fr/ruffier/) in team [Larsen team](https://team.inria.fr/larsen/en).

My [PhD thesis](https://hal.in2p3.fr/LORIA-AIS/tel-03765560v1)(in french) was about learning a control policy for a small UAV under self created wind perturbations.
