I'm a computer science teacher in [Lycée Descartes](https://www.lyc-descartes.fr/) in Tours (France).

Before that I was a PhD student at INRIA under supervision of [Jean-Baptiste Mouret](https://members.loria.fr/JBMouret/) and [Franck Ruffier](http://www.ism.univ-amu.fr/ruffier/) inside [Larsen team](https://team.inria.fr/larsen/en).

My [PhD thesis](https://www.theses.fr/2022LORR0072) was about learning a control policy for a small UAV under self created wind perturbations.
